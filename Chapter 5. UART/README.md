## Configure Usart on the nucleo
When we created the project, usart was setup with standard settings. The auto generated code can be found in main.c and is shown below.

```c
/**
  * @brief USART2 Initialization Function
  * @param None
  * @retval None
  */
static void MX_USART2_UART_Init(void)
{

  /* USER CODE BEGIN USART2_Init 0 */

  /* USER CODE END USART2_Init 0 */

  /* USER CODE BEGIN USART2_Init 1 */

  /* USER CODE END USART2_Init 1 */
  huart2.Instance = USART2;
  huart2.Init.BaudRate = 115200;
  huart2.Init.WordLength = UART_WORDLENGTH_8B;
  huart2.Init.StopBits = UART_STOPBITS_1;
  huart2.Init.Parity = UART_PARITY_NONE;
  huart2.Init.Mode = UART_MODE_TX_RX;
  huart2.Init.HwFlowCtl = UART_HWCONTROL_NONE;
  huart2.Init.OverSampling = UART_OVERSAMPLING_16;
  if (HAL_UART_Init(&huart2) != HAL_OK)
  {
    Error_Handler();
  }
  /* USER CODE BEGIN USART2_Init 2 */

  /* USER CODE END USART2_Init 2 */

}

```

In the given code snippet we can see: 
(Skal skrive om, mangler info)
- we are using USART2
- baudrate is set to 115200
- 8 bit
- parity is none
- tx rx
- flow ctl none
- oversampling is to 16

This is the standard settings for alot of devices, but if you need to change these paramertes. You need to go the the "Pinout & configuration" tab again. Then go to, connectivity -> USART2 -> Parameter settings. Here one can modify the diffrent parameters. After changing them, press "ctrl + s" and then new configeration will be gernerated.

## Setup putty to send commands.

First we need to setup putty to be able to send serial commands to our nucleo board. Set com port, baud rate and etc., like you did in chapter 1. Click on Terminal in the option menu to the right. Here we need to enable "implicit CR in every LF", local echo to "Force on". (see image)

## Transmit using POLL method

Poll method is the most simple way of transferring data. The down side of poll is, while transmitting the data it will block all other operation. The good thing about poll is, its good for transferring large amount of data simple and good if the programs jobs are only transferring over usart. 

The setup for poll is simple and was the one we used in chapter 1. The code snippet below shows a basic setup.

-  First we include string.h

``` c
/* Private includes ----------------------------------------------------------*/
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include "string.h"
```

- Define a buffer

```c
int main(void)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */
	uint8_t buf[25];
```

- Then Copy a string to our buffer and transmit it.

```C
  /* Infinite loop */
  /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  while (1)
  {
	  strcpy((char*)buf, "Hello world\r\n");
	  HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart2, buf, strlen((char*)buf), HAL_MAX_DELAY);
	  HAL_Delay(1000);
```

In the code above we give HAL_UART_Transmit "HAL_MAX_DELAY" as a argument. This is the timeout timespan for the task. This is needed for any blocking process. HAL_MAX_DELAY timespan is multipel days and is only used if you dont care how long you are blocking. When you using poll you need to consider the timespan needed for your task, if the timespan is too short the task will terminated and the remaing data won't be sendt. 

Then to resolve this problem we can use interupt or DMA for transmitting the data.

## Transmit using Interrupt

The first step for setting up the usart interrupt is to enable it in NVIC Settings, go to Pinout & Configuration -> Connectivity -> USART2( or whatever port you are using) -> NVIC Settings. (See image below) Then press "ctrl + s" and generate the new code.

<p align="center">
    <img src = "setupInterrupt.png"width="350">
</p>

Then to transmit in interrupt mode call "HAL_UART_Transmit_IT". In the example below, a led is toggle every second, just as we did it in chapter 1., but this time we dont want to add the delay from transmitting with POLL. We do this by using interrupt mode and run the tranmission in the background.   

```c
  /* Infinite loop */
  /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  while (1)
  {
	  strcpy((char*)buf, "Hello world\r\n");
	  HAL_UART_Transmit_IT(&huart2, buf, strlen((char*)buf));
	  HAL_Delay(1000);

```

One can then add "HAL_UART_TxCplitCallBack" outside of the main function. This function gets call when the interrupt transmission is completed. In the given code snippet below, HAL_UART_Transmit_IT is called again every time it completes. 

```c
/* Private user code ---------------------------------------------------------*/
/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */
void HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback(UART_HandleTypeDef *huart)
{
	HAL_UART_Transmit_IT(&huart2, buf, strlen((char*)buf));
}
```

## Receive with POLL method
POLL method is the most simple way of receiving data over usart. Just as in the transmit part, we can receive with POLL with the default settings of the project. 

In this example we are gonna show how to Receive a string and tell about the pitfalls.

- First lets create 2 buffers

```c
/* Private variables ---------------------------------------------------------*/
uint8_t Receive_buf[4];
```

- Then in the main loop add HAL_UART_Receive()

```c
  /* Infinite loop */
  /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  while (1)
  {
	  HAL_UART_Receive(&huart2, Receive_buf, 10, 1000); 
```

In this code snippet we are receiving over Usart for 1000 miliseconds(Timeout), for a message that is 10 bytes long. Here it is important to remeber that this is blocking our system for 1000 miliseconds and if you have a buffer that takes longer to read then you timeout, you won't get the whole message. 

To test this, set a break point at the uart receive line and setup putty as described earlier. Then cehck what get writing to the buffer.

## Receive with Interrupt

To setup the interrupt on Usart for receiving, we do the same as in the transmission part. Then just as in the tranmission part we start with setup our usart receive interrupt. 

```c
  /* Initialize all configured peripherals */
  MX_GPIO_Init();
  MX_USART2_UART_Init();
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
  HAL_UART_Receive_IT (&huart2, Receive_buf, 4);
```

Then outside of our main we define our callback function, and call the usart receive interrupt again. If not the system will stop listining after the first interrupt. 

```c
/* Private user code ---------------------------------------------------------*/
/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */
void HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback(UART_HandleTypeDef *huart) 
{
  HAL_UART_Receive_IT(&huart2, Receive_buf, 4); 
}
```

With this method we have a non blocking way of continously listen for serial input. 

Then to test the code, set a breakpoint in the callback method and run the program in debug mode.
