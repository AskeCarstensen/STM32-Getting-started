# Chapter 2. General-purpose input/output - GPIO

This chapter will show howto 

- Configure GPIO pins to input and output

- Set Pull-Down or Pull-up

- Configure GPIO speed

## Exercise 1: Configure one input and one output

First we need to find two GPIO pins that are not reserved on the board. Pick any pins that have a grey color in the pin configurator. In our case it is GPIOA pin 10 and GPIOB pin 5 (see image below).
